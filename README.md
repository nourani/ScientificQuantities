ScientificQuantities
====================

A template based C++11 class for definition and conversion of scientific quantities. 

The base class is based on SI unit. From these we derive the "Derived SI units". 
All the BASE and DERIVED using are implemented. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_System_of_Units#Units_and_prefixes

I created this class so I would avoid having to keep track of what units is being used across my code. These classes do the following:
- They explicitely enforce the programmer to assign a unit when creating a variable: Angle a1 = 90_deg; Angle a2 = 1.2_rad;
- They prevent you from incorrectly performing calculations between units; what is kg⋅m2⋅s−3⋅A−1? WATT!! This is correct but K⋅m probably not!
- They do the conversions for you: Length l1 = 120_m; l1.in(km) => 0.12; Length l1 = 120_m + 33_cm;
